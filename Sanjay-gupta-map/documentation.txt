Sanjay Gupta Map: Code Usage and Editing Guide

1.) Creating SVG file for Map
  - Use photopea to create svg map file (tutorial link here)
  - Think of just one map's name, you will later use it on your entire script and css
  - Add your newly created SVG map by copying the svg code you created in photopea and paste it inside webflow using "embed code" element
    - The svg file structure should be like this, and make sure to add svg id
        <svg id="svg-[Replace the word “yourmapname” with your chosen map name]" {...xxxxxxx} >
          <path d="sample-only...xxxxxx xxxxx">
          // ...add the rest of your remaining paths
        </svg>
2.) Adding/Updating CSS
  - just copy all the existing CSS styles from the map.html(we can update it later) and paste it below your svg file
  - then we just need to update the following CSS(all #id)
    -#svg-[Replace “yourmapname” with your chosed map's name]
    -#path-shadow-[Replace “yourmapname” with your chosed map's name]
  - Congrats! Now your done creating the html and css, lets now procced on map's script

3.) Adding/Updating script(data array)
  -just copy the entire script in map.js(we can update it later), and paste it in another embed code element(youcan paste it at the very bottom of all section inside html body)
  -rename the existing array name with your desired map's name
  -and then we need to update data array's content(donnot use the existing content example), take note that objects inside array should be matched with your svg's path
    -objects inside array should be update as follows:
        -name: name for each map's places
        -fill: default color of specific place(in idle state)
        -link: redirect link for each places inside the map
        -offsetX: use to adjust text element's position horizontally(just remove in array's specific object if offset is not needed)
        -offsetY: use to adjust text element's position vertically(just remove in array's specific object if offset is not needed)
        -fontSize: use to adjust text element's size(default is 18px if you will not add value, remove in array's specific object if changing fontSize is not necessary)
        -disable: use to disable specific location, just add disable:true in array(just remove in array's specific object if you not want to disable)
        -wordsPerLine: helps when you want to make the next word be placed into next line, set desired word per line(the deafault value will be 2 words per line if you will not add any)
  -Congrats! Now you are done with the data, let's proceed in updating scripts

4.) Updating script(function)
  -update the function name "applyFunc", you will see at the very bottom of the script
    -applyFunc([Replace “yourmapname” with your chosen map's name], [add your array name here, same name as your map's name]);
  -Congrats! Now you are done with the initial map, let's proceed on how to to customize overall theme of your map

5.) How to customize map's CSS and animation?
  -In your CSS code(root) copied from map.html, you just need to update the following value according to your client's theme and preference
    /* Colors */
    --color-map-border: this is the border color of each map in idle state
    --color-map-text: this is the color of each map text in idle state
    --color-map-text-hover: this is the color of each map text in hover state
    --color-map-text-bg-hover: this is the backgrouond color of each map's text in hover state
    --color-map-border-hover: this is the border color of each map in hover state
    --color-map-bg-hover: this is the backgrouond map in hover state

    /* Typography */
    --font-map-style: this is the style of each map text;

    /* Borders */
    --border-map-width: this is the border thickness of each map's places
    --border-map-width-hover: this is the border thickness of each map's place in hover state  

    /* Motion */
    --transition-map-duration: this is the durations of how fast the animation will be  
    --translate-y-map-hover: this is how far the map's place will go overtop of other

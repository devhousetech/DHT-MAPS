Sanjay Gupta Map: Code Usage and Editing Guide

1.) Creating SVG file for Map
  - Use photopea to create svg map file (tutorial link here)
  - Think of your desired map name, you will later use it on your entire code and styles
  - Add your newly created SVG map by copying the svg code you created in photopea and paste it inside webflow using "embed code" element
    - The svg file structure should be like this, and make sure to add svg id:
        <svg id="svg-[add your desired map name here(w/o bracket)]" ... >
          <path d="sample-onlyxxxxxx xxxxx">
          // add the rest of your reamining paths
        </svg>
2.) Adding/Updating CSS
  - just copy the existing styles from the example code(we can update it later), for now we just need to update the following css content(class/id naming):
    -path-[add your map name here(w/o bracket)]
    -#path-shadow-[add your map name here(w/o bracket)]
    -path-text-[add your map name here(w/o bracket)]
  - updated css can be place in another embed code element or either place it together with your existing embed code element you recenlty used for svg map file(which ever works best)
  - Congrats! Now your done creating the html and styles, lets now procced on map's script

3.) Adding/Updating script(data array)
  -just copy the entire example script(we can update it later), and paste it in another embed code element
  -rename the existing dataArray name with your own map's name(example are "milton" -> "yourmapsname")
  -update data array's content(donnot use the content example of milton and oakville), all objects inside array should be matched with your svg file
    -all objects inside array should be update as follows:
        -name: name for each map's places
        -fill: default color of specific place(before hover state)
        -link: redirect link for each places inside the map
        -offsetX: use to adjust text element's position horizontally(remove in array's specific object if offset is not needed)
        -offsetY: use to adjust adjust text element's position vertically(remove in array's specific object if offset is not needed)
        -wordsPerLine: helps when you want to make the next word be placed into next line, set desired word per line(the value will be 2 words per line if you will not add any)
  -Congrats! Now you are done with the data, let's proceed to script's functions

4.) Updating script(function)
  -update the code the you will see at the very bottom of the script
    -applyFunc([add your map name here(w/o bracket and must be inside the double quote)], [update this with your dataArray name (w/o bracket)]);
  -Congrats! Now you are done with the initial map, let's proceed on how to to customize overall looks of the map
